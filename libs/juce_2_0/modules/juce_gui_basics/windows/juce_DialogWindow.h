/**
    A dialog-box style window.

    This class is a convenient way of creating a DocumentWindow with a close button
    that can be triggered by pressing the escape key.

    Any of the methods available to a DocumentWindow or ResizableWindow are also
    available to this, so it can be made resizable, have a menu bar, etc.

    To add items to the box, see the ResizableWindow::setContentOwned() or
    ResizableWindow::setContentNonOwned() methods. Don't add components directly to this
    class - always put them in a content component!

    You'll need to override the DocumentWindow::closeButtonPressed() method to handle
    the user clicking the close button - for more info, see the DocumentWindow
    help.

        This will open and display a DialogWindow containing a given component, making it
        modal, but returning immediately to allow the dialog to finish in its own time. If
        you want to block and run a modal loop until the dialog is dismissed, use showModalDialog()
        instead.

        To close the dialog programatically, you should call exitModalState (returnValue) on
        the DialogWindow that is created. To find a pointer to this window from your
        contentComponent, you can do something like this:
        @code
        Dialogwindow* dw = contentComponent->findParentComponentOfClass<DialogWindow>();

        if (dw != nullptr)
            dw->exitModalState (1234);

                                    be before calling this method. The component won't
                                    be deleted by this call, so you can re-use it or delete
                                    it afterwards
        @param componentToCentreAround  if this is non-zero, it indicates a component that
                                    you'd like to show this dialog box in front of. See the
                                    DocumentWindow::centreAroundComponent() method for more
                                    info on this parameter
        @param backgroundColour     a colour to use for the dialog box's background colour
        @param escapeKeyTriggersCloseButton if true, then pressing the escape key will cause the
                                            close button to be triggered
        @param shouldBeResizable    if true, the dialog window has either a resizable border, or
                                    a corner resizer
