/** This suffix is used for naming all Obj-C classes that are used inside juce.

    Because of the flat naming structure used by Obj-C, you can get horrible situations where
    two DLLs are loaded into a host, each of which uses classes with the same names, and these get
    cross-linked so that when you make a call to a class that you thought was private, it ends up
    actually calling into a similarly named class in the other module's address space.

    By changing this macro to a unique value, you ensure that all the obj-C classes in your app
    have unique names, and should avoid this problem.

    If you're using the amalgamated version, you can just set this macro to something unique before
    you include juce_amalgamated.cpp.
