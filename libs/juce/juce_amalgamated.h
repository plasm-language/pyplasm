	Very simple container class to hold a pointer to some data on the heap.

	When you need to allocate some heap storage for something, always try to use
	this class instead of allocating the memory directly using malloc/free.

	A HeapBlock<char> object can be treated in pretty much exactly the same way
	as an char*, but as long as you allocate it on the stack or as a class member,
	it's almost impossible for it to leak memory.

	It also makes your code much more concise and readable than doing the same thing
	using direct allocations,

	E.g. instead of this:
	@code
		int* temp = (int*) juce_malloc (1024 * sizeof (int));
		memcpy (temp, xyz, 1024 * sizeof (int));
		juce_free (temp);
		temp = (int*) juce_calloc (2048 * sizeof (int));
		temp[0] = 1234;
		memcpy (foobar, temp, 2048 * sizeof (int));
		juce_free (temp);
	@endcode

	..you could just write this:
	@code
		HeapBlock <int> temp (1024);
		memcpy (temp, xyz, 1024 * sizeof (int));
		temp.calloc (2048);
		temp[0] = 1234;
		memcpy (foobar, temp, 2048 * sizeof (int));
	@endcode

	The class is extremely lightweight, containing only a pointer to the
	data, and exposes malloc/realloc/calloc/free methods that do the same jobs
	as their less object-oriented counterparts. Despite adding safety, you probably
	won't sacrifice any performance by using this in place of normal pointers.

/** Used to build a tree of elements representing an XML document.

	An XML document can be parsed into a tree of XmlElements, each of which
	represents an XML tag structure, and which may itself contain other
	nested elements.

	An XmlElement can also be converted back into a text document, and has
	lots of useful methods for manipulating its attributes and sub-elements,
	so XmlElements can actually be used as a handy general-purpose data
	structure.

	Here's an example of parsing some elements: @code
	// check we're looking at the right kind of document..
	if (myElement->hasTagName ("ANIMALS"))
	{
		// now we'll iterate its sub-elements looking for 'giraffe' elements..
		forEachXmlChildElement (*myElement, e)
		{
			if (e->hasTagName ("GIRAFFE"))
			{
				// found a giraffe, so use some of its attributes..

				String giraffeName  = e->getStringAttribute ("name");
				int giraffeAge      = e->getIntAttribute ("age");
				bool isFriendly     = e->getBoolAttribute ("friendly");
			}
		}
	}
	@endcode

	And here's an example of how to create an XML document from scratch: @code
	// create an outer node called "ANIMALS"
	XmlElement animalsList ("ANIMALS");

	for (int i = 0; i < numAnimals; ++i)
	{
		// create an inner element..
		XmlElement* giraffe = new XmlElement ("GIRAFFE");

		giraffe->setAttribute ("name", "nigel");
		giraffe->setAttribute ("age", 10);
		giraffe->setAttribute ("friendly", true);

		// ..and add our new element to the parent node
		animalsList.addChildElement (giraffe);
	}

	// now we can turn the whole thing into a text document..
	String myXmlDoc = animalsList.createDocument (String::empty);

	Internally, the list of items is kept sorted (which means that whatever

	capable of being copied or moved with a straightforward memcpy, rather than

/**
	Holds a set of objects and can invoke a member function callback on each object
	in the set with a single call.

	Use a ListenerList to manage a set of objects which need a callback, and you
	can invoke a member function by simply calling call() or callChecked().

	E.g.
	@code
	class MyListenerType
	{
	public:
		void myCallbackMethod (int foo, bool bar);
	};

	ListenerList <MyListenerType> listeners;
	listeners.add (someCallbackObjects...);

	// This will invoke myCallbackMethod (1234, true) on each of the objects
	// in the list...
	listeners.call (&MyListenerType::myCallbackMethod, 1234, true);
	@endcode

	If you add or remove listeners from the list during one of the callbacks - i.e. while
	it's in the middle of iterating the listeners, then it's guaranteed that no listeners
	will be mistakenly called after they've been removed, but it may mean that some of the
	listeners could be called more than once, or not at all, depending on the list's order.

	Sometimes, there's a chance that invoking one of the callbacks might result in the
	list itself being deleted while it's still iterating - to survive this situation, you can
	use callChecked() instead of call(), passing it a local object to act as a "BailOutChecker".
	The BailOutChecker must implement a method of the form "bool shouldBailOut()", and
	the list will check this after each callback to determine whether it should abort the
	operation. For an example of a bail-out checker, see the Component::BailOutChecker class,
	which can be used to check when a Component has been deleted. See also
	ListenerList::DummyBailOutChecker, which is a dummy checker that always returns false.

	A powerful tree structure that can be used to hold free-form data, and which can

	A ValueTree contains a list of named properties as var objects, and also holds
	any number of sub-trees.

	Create ValueTree objects on the stack, and don't be afraid to copy them around, as
	they're simply a lightweight reference to a shared data container. Creating a copy
	of another ValueTree simply creates a new reference to the same underlying object - to
	make a separate, deep copy of a tree you should explicitly call createCopy().

	Each ValueTree has a type name, in much the same way as an XmlElement has a tag name,
	and much of the structure of a ValueTree is similar to an XmlElement tree.
	You can convert a ValueTree to and from an XmlElement, and as long as the XML doesn't
	contain text elements, the conversion works well and makes a good serialisation
	format. They can also be serialised to a binary format, which is very fast and compact.

	All the methods that change data take an optional UndoManager, which will be used
	to track any changes to the object. For this to work, you have to be careful to
	consistently always use the same UndoManager for all operations to any node inside
	the tree.

	A ValueTree can only be a child of one parent at a time, so if you're moving one from
	one tree to another, be careful to always remove it first, before adding it. This
	could also mess up your undo/redo chain, so be wary! In a debug build you should hit
	assertions if you try to do anything dangerous, but there are still plenty of ways it
	could go wrong.

	Listeners can be added to a ValueTree to be told when properies change and when
	nodes are added or removed.

	Macro to declare member variables and methods for a singleton class.

	To use this, add the line juce_DeclareSingleton (MyClass, doNotRecreateAfterDeletion)
	to the class's definition.

	Then put a macro juce_ImplementSingleton (MyClass) along with the class's
	implementation code.

	It's also a very good idea to also add the call clearSingletonInstance() in your class's
	destructor, in case it is deleted by other means than deleteInstance()

	Clients can then call the static method MyClass::getInstance() to get a pointer
	to the singleton, or MyClass::getInstanceWithoutCreating() which will return 0 if
	no instance currently exists.

	e.g. @code

		class MySingleton
		{
		public:
			MySingleton()
			{
			}

			~MySingleton()
			{
				// this ensures that no dangling pointers are left when the
				// singleton is deleted.
				clearSingletonInstance();
			}

			juce_DeclareSingleton (MySingleton, false)
		};

		juce_ImplementSingleton (MySingleton)

		// example of usage:
		MySingleton* m = MySingleton::getInstance(); // creates the singleton if there isn't already one.

		...

		MySingleton::deleteInstance(); // safely deletes the singleton (if it's been created).

	@endcode

	If doNotRecreateAfterDeletion = true, it won't allow the object to be created more
	than once during the process's lifetime - i.e. after you've created and deleted the
	object, getInstance() will refuse to create another one. This can be useful to stop
	objects being accidentally re-created during your app's shutdown code.

	If you know that your object will only be created and deleted by a single thread, you
	can use the slightly more efficient juce_DeclareSingleton_SingleThreaded() macro instead
	of this one.

	This is basically a look-up table of strings and their translated equivalents.
	It can be loaded from a text file, so that you can supply a set of localised
	versions of strings that you use in your app.

	To use it in your code, simply call the translate() method on each string that
	might have foreign versions, and if none is found, the method will just return
	the original string.

	The translation file should start with some lines specifying a description of
	the language it contains, and also a list of ISO country codes where it might
	be appropriate to use the file. After that, each line of the file should contain
	a pair of quoted strings with an '=' sign.

	E.g. for a french translation, the file might be:

	@code
	language: French
	countries: fr be mc ch lu

	"hello" = "bonjour"
	"goodbye" = "au revoir"
	@endcode

	If the strings need to contain a quote character, they can use '\"' instead, and
	if the first non-whitespace character on a line isn't a quote, then it's ignored,
	(you can use this to add comments).

	Note that this is a singleton class, so don't create or destroy the object directly.
	There's also a TRANS(text) macro defined to make it easy to use the this.

	E.g. @code
	printSomething (TRANS("hello"));
	@endcode

	This macro is used in the Juce classes themselves, so your application has a chance to
	intercept and translate any internal Juce text strings that might be shown. (You can easily
	get a list of all the messages by searching for the TRANS() macro in the Juce source
	code).

	One of these objects holds a list of all the commands your app can perform,
	and despatches these commands when needed.

	Application commands are a good way to trigger actions in your app, e.g. "Quit",
	"Copy", "Paste", etc. Menus, buttons and keypresses can all be given commands
	to invoke automatically, which means you don't have to handle the result of a menu
	or button click manually. Commands are despatched to ApplicationCommandTarget objects
	which can choose which events they want to handle.

	This architecture also allows for nested ApplicationCommandTargets, so that for example
	you could have two different objects, one inside the other, both of which can respond to
	a "delete" command. Depending on which one has focus, the command will be sent to the
	appropriate place, regardless of whether it was triggered by a menu, keypress or some other
	method.

	To set up your app to use commands, you'll need to do the following:

	- Create a global ApplicationCommandManager to hold the list of all possible
	  commands. (This will also manage a set of key-mappings for them).

	- Make some of your UI components (or other objects) inherit from ApplicationCommandTarget.
	  This allows the object to provide a list of commands that it can perform, and
	  to handle them.

	- Register each type of command using ApplicationCommandManager::registerAllCommandsForTarget(),
	  or ApplicationCommandManager::registerCommand().

	- If you want key-presses to trigger your commands, use the ApplicationCommandManager::getKeyMappings()
	  method to access the key-mapper object, which you will need to register as a key-listener
	  in whatever top-level component you're using. See the KeyPressMappingSet class for more help
	  about setting this up.

	- Use methods such as PopupMenu::addCommandItem() or Button::setCommandToTrigger() to
	  cause these commands to be invoked automatically.

	- Commands can be invoked directly by your code using ApplicationCommandManager::invokeDirectly().

	When a command is invoked, the ApplicationCommandManager will try to choose the best
	ApplicationCommandTarget to receive the specified command. To do this it will use the
	current keyboard focus to see which component might be interested, and will search the
	component hierarchy for those that also implement the ApplicationCommandTarget interface.
	If an ApplicationCommandTarget isn't interested in the command that is being invoked, then
	the next one in line will be tried (see the ApplicationCommandTarget::getNextCommandTarget()
	method), and so on until ApplicationCommandTarget::getNextCommandTarget() returns 0. At this
	point if the command still hasn't been performed, it will be passed to the current
	JUCEApplication object (which is itself an ApplicationCommandTarget).

	To exert some custom control over which ApplicationCommandTarget is chosen to invoke a command,
	you can override the ApplicationCommandManager::getFirstCommandTarget() method and choose
	the object yourself.

/**
	Manages the state of some audio and midi i/o devices.

	This class keeps tracks of a currently-selected audio device, through
	with which it continuously streams data from an audio callback, as well as
	one or more midi inputs.

	The idea is that your application will create one global instance of this object,
	and let it take care of creating and deleting specific types of audio devices
	internally. So when the device is changed, your callbacks will just keep running
	without having to worry about this.

	The manager can save and reload all of its device settings as XML, which
	makes it very easy for you to save and reload the audio setup of your
	application.

	And to make it easy to let the user change its settings, there's a component
	to do just that - the AudioDeviceSelectorComponent class, which contains a set of
	device selection/sample-rate/latency controls.

	To use an AudioDeviceManager, create one, and use initialise() to set it up. Then
	call addAudioCallback() to register your audio callback with it, and use that to process
	your audio data.

	The manager also acts as a handy hub for incoming midi messages, allowing a

		should be replaced with the filter's output.

		So for example if your filter has 2 input channels and 4 output channels, then
		the buffer will contain 4 channels, the first two being filled with the
		input data. Your filter should read these, do its processing, and replace
		the contents of all 4 channels with its output.

		Or if your filter has 5 inputs and 2 outputs, the buffer will have 5 channels,
		all filled with data, and your filter should overwrite the first 2 of these
		with its output. But be VERY careful not to write anything to the last 3
		channels, as these might be mapped to memory that the host assumes is read-only!

		Note that if you have more outputs than inputs, then only those channels that
		correspond to an input channel are guaranteed to contain sensible data - e.g.
		in the case of 2 inputs and 4 outputs, the first two channels contain the input,
		but the last two channels may contain garbage, so you should be careful not to
		let this pass through without being overwritten or cleared.

		Also note that the buffer may have more channels than are strictly necessary,
		but your should only read/write from the ones that your filter is supposed to
		be using.

		The number of samples in these buffers is NOT guaranteed to be the same for every

		with the midi messages for this block. Each message's timestamp will indicate the
		message's time, as a number of samples from the start of the block.

		Any messages left in the midi buffer when this method has finished are assumed to
		be the filter's midi output. This means that your filter should be careful to
		clear any incoming messages from the array if it doesn't want them to be passed-on.

		Be very careful about what you do in this callback - it's going to be called by
		the audio thread, so any kind of interaction with the UI is absolutely

			myCommandManager->registerAllCommandsForTarget (myCommandTarget2);

			// this will use the command manager to initialise the KeyPressMappingSet with
			// the default keypresses that were specified when the targets added their commands
			// to the manager.

	@code

		MyComp()
		{
			myLayout.setItemLayout (0,	  // for item 0
									50, 100,	// must be between 50 and 100 pixels in size
									-0.6);	  // and its preferred size is 60% of the total available space

			myLayout.setItemLayout (1,	  // for item 1
									-0.2, -0.6, // size must be between 20% and 60% of the available space
									50);	// and its preferred size is 50 pixels
		}

		void resized()
		{
			// make a list of two of our child components that we want to reposition
			Component* comps[] = { myComp1, myComp2 };

			// this will position the 2 components, one above the other, to fit
			// vertically into the rectangle provided.
			myLayout.layOutComponents (comps, 2,
									   0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight(),
